                    Employee administration that uses coaching to motivate and
                    build trust with workers can unlock enormous human
                    potential. Yet, communication tactics alone may fall short
                    in the face of multi-generational workforces, rising numbers
                    of freelance workers and complex regulations. Technology,
                    whether itâ€™s workforce administration software or a human
                    capital administration solution, can often help business
                    leaders maintain productivity more effectively in rapidly
                    changing environments.
